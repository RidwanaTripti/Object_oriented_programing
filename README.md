# Object_oriented_programing
   Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields, and the code is in the form of procedures. A common feature of objects is that procedures are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. OOP used in many programming languages, such as Dart, Java, C++, Python, etc.[OOP is not a programming language,it is just a pattern to write programming language]

# Why we need OOP/Advantages?
   1. It is easy to understand and use.
   2. It increases reusability and decreases complexity.
   3. The productivity of programmers increases.
   4. It makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.
   5. It promotes teamwork and collaboration.
   6. It reduces the repetition of code. 

# Features of OOP
   1. Class
   2. Object
   3. Encapsulation
   4. Inheritance
   5. Polymorphism
   6. Abstraction

   ## CLASS
   Classes are user define data type that act as the blueprint for indivual objects,attributes and methods. Class has two parts -
       
         ##### Properties - variables in class defines as properties.Properties has two part -
          1. local variable - when we use properties in method it called local variable and it can't use outside the method.
          2. global variable - when we use properties in class but not inside method it called global properties/variable.global variable or properties can use any places.
               
         ##### methods - functions in class defines as methods.

   ## Object
   Real world entity.objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process.

* What is object and class in OOP? 
      A class is a template for creating objects in a program, whereas the object is an instance (উদাহরণ/দৃষ্টান্ত) of a class. A class is a logical entity, while an object is a physical entity. A class does not allocate memory space; on the other hand, an object allocates memory space.
